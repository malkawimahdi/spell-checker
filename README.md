# Dictionary
 
This repository contains a program that allows you to use a dictionary on (.txt) files that outputs the misspelt words while providing the time to process the text.

A GNU Make, Makefile has been provided. To compile the program, clone this repository, enter the directory, then:
```console
mahdi@malkawimahdi:~$  make speller
```

## Usage

The program generates the desired output as long as the arguments are valid.
```console
mahdi@malkawimahdi:~$  ./speller /dictionaries/large /texts/aca/txt
```
The program will then output the misspelt words in the terminal within the text.
