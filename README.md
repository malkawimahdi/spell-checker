# Dictionary
 
This repository contains a program, that allows you to use a dictionary on (.txt) files, that outputs the misspelt words, whilst also providing the time to process the text.

A Makefile has been provided. To compile the program, clone this repository, enter the directory then:
```console
mahdi@malkawimahdi:~$  make speller
```
## Usage

The program generates the desired output as long as the arguements provided are valid.
```console
mahdi@malkawimahdi:~$  ./speller /dictionaries/large /texts/aca/txt
```
The program will then output in the terminal the misspelt words located within the text.

##Note
This program is used by me personally on my Arch based system,to locate the spelling on smaller files.
A later revision of this program may proceed.
